This allows us to compare “real” prices across years and determine whether the video game industry has followed general inflation trends or diverged from them.\n\nKey Context:\n\nBetween 2020-2024, Europe experienced significant inflation (~23% cumulative). If game prices had perfectly tracked inflation, a €60 game from 2020 should cost approximately €74 in 2024. However, the industry standard has only recently moved from €60 to €70, suggesting potential price stickiness or consumer resistance to larger increases.","type":"content","url":"/nb2-prices-analysis#id-1-introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Video Game Price Analysis: Impact of Inflation and COVID-19","lvl2":"2.

Games became increasingly affordable (unsustainable).\n\n2020-2022: Publishers raised prices to catch up with inflation. The €69.99 AAA standard emerged.\n\n2023-2024: Prices now match inflation (ratio = 1.0). Indie boom drove Budget tier to 44% of market.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe “cheaper games” narrative is false. Publishers successfully closed the inflation gap. The lower average reflects an indie game boom, not price cuts. The 2015-2019 period was the anomaly.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/nb2-prices-analysis#understanding-the-price-drop-compositional-shift-not-price-cuts","position":49},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Video Game Price Analysis: Impact of Inflation and COVID-19","lvl3":"Tier-Specific COVID Impact","lvl2":"5.
